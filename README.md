# Sleeved. io

The purpose of this site is to help the all of the board game geeks out there sleeve their precious games! The suggested sleeves are only Mayday sleeves, however I have also listed the card size for manual calculations. 

##### **How to use it:**
- Type in the name of a game into the search bar
- Click the magnifying glass
_Results should appear wit that game name (if they exist)_ 
- Press the plus (+) icon to add the game to your "cart"
- Add all the games you need sleeved
- Cick the (x) icon to remove a game from the "cart"

### **Verified Games**

A select few number of games have a checkmark (‚òë) next to their name. These games have been personally measured and counted by me, and if I could, I would offer a guarantee. üòÅ

### **Game missing?**

 If you'd like a game to be added, post a new issue in the [Issues forum](https://github.com/thedeviousdev/Card-Sleeves/issues) with a title of `[Request] Game Name`
 
 ### **Wrong information?**
 
 Most of the games have information provided by the gaming community, but it's possible it is incorrect (sorry)! If you have the game in question, please help out and post a new issue in the [Issues forum](https://github.com/thedeviousdev/Card-Sleeves/issues). Follow the following format:
 
Set the post title to `[Update] Game Name`
```
**Game Name: ** 
**Year: ** (if possible)

**Sleeve Size #1**
**Width (mm): **
**Height (mm): **
**Quantity: **

**Sleeve Size #2 **
**Width (mm): **
**Height (mm): **
**Quantity: **
```
_Add as many sleeve sizes as necessary_

### **Future Updates**
- Eventually I'd like to allow a select community to update and add games themselves (Call out for contributors!)
- Lock down the edit pages by login
- Allow multiple of the same game to be added
- Analytics to see what are the most commonly searched games
- Style the "cart" a little better
- Add a 'purchase' button that sends the user to Amazon
- Allow users to change the sleeve brand
- Create an API endpoint for peopel to export this data. 

### **Thanks!**

Special thanks to the sleeving community! I have imported all the sleeves from the [Mayday Sleeves list](https://www.maydaygames.com/pages/sleeves-by-game) and am working through [Adam Kranzel's list on Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/164572/card-sleeve-sizes-games). I also use the [Board Game Geek's API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to pull in the data for new games.
