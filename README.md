# Sleeved.io

The purpose of this site is to help the all of the board game geeks out there sleeve their precious games! The suggested sleeves are only Mayday sleeves, however I have also listed the card size for manual calculations. 

##### **How to use it:**
- Type in the name of a game into the search bar
- Click the magnifying glass
_Results should appear wit that game name (if they exist)_ 
- Press the plus (‚ûï) icon to add the game to your "cart"
- Add all the games you need sleeved
- Cick the (‚ùå) icon to remove a game from the "cart"

### **Verified Games**

A select few number of games have a checkmark (‚òë) next to their name. These games have been personally measured and counted by me, and if I could, I would offer a guarantee. üòÅ

### **Game missing?**

 If you'd like a game to be added, post a new issue in the [Issues forum](https://github.com/thedeviousdev/Card-Sleeves/issues).
 
Set the post title to `[Request] Game Name`
 ```
**Game Name:** 
**Board Game Geek URL:** 
**Year/Edition:** (if possible)
```
 
 ### **Wrong/New information?**
 
 Most of the games have information provided by the gaming community, but it's possible it is incorrect or has not been added yet (sorry)! If you have the game in question, please help out and post a new issue in the [Issues forum](https://github.com/thedeviousdev/Card-Sleeves/issues). Follow the following format:
 
Set the post title to `[Update] Game Name`
```
**Game Name:**

**Year/Edition:** (if possible)

**Sleeve Size 1**
**Quantity:**
**Width (mm):**
**Height (mm):**

**Sleeve Size 2**

**Height (mm):**
```
_Add as many sleeve sizes as necessary_

### **Thanks!**

Special thanks to the sleeving community! I have imported all the sleeves from the [Mayday Sleeves list](https://www.maydaygames.com/pages/sleeves-by-game) and am working through [Adam Kranzel's list on Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/164572/card-sleeve-sizes-games). I also use the [Board Game Geek's API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to pull in the data for new games.
